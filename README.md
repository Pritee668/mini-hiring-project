# Mini Hiring Platform

A modern, lightweight web application that simulates the functionality of a **hiring management system**.  
This project demonstrates how recruiters and hiring managers can:

- Post and manage job openings
- Manage candidate profiles
- Conduct and track assessments

Itâ€™s designed as a **mini project** to showcase full-stack thinking (frontend focus and mock server using mirag.js) with a clean UI, modular code structure, and easily extendable features.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Backend (Mock):** Mirage.js (mock API server)
- **Styling:** CSS
- **Other Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, npm/yarn

## Motivation

The hiring process involves managing many moving parts: jobs, candidates, and assessments. Large-scale Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) can be overwhelming for beginners.

This **Mini Hiring Platform** is a simplified version of an ATS that demonstrates:

- **React best practices** (component structure, hooks,useState, state management)
- **Clean project architecture** (pages, components, services separation)
- **Interactive UI** (drag-and-drop jobs, archive/unarchive, candidate profiles)

This project is ideal for:

- Students building portfolio projects
- Developers practicing React/JavaScript
- Recruiters reviewing coding style

## Live Demo

[Mini Hiring Platform Live](https://recuritease-platform.netlify.app/#/)

## Usage

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
2. Navigate through the following pages:
   - **Dashboard** â†’ Overview of jobs & candidates.
   - **Jobs Page** â†’ Create, edit, reorder, archive jobs.
   - **Candidates Page** â†’ View profiles, add notes.
   - **Assessments Page** â†’ Manage and track assessments.
3. Try drag-and-drop on the Jobs Board to reorder postings.

4. Try drag-and-drop on the Jobs Board to reorder postings.

## Bonus Feature:

** `Referred By` **
The **`referredBy`** field has been added to the `candidate` model to track whether a candidate was referred by someone.

### Key Points

- `referredBy` is **independent of stage** (`applied`, `screen`, `tech`, `offer`, `hired`, `rejected`).
- A candidate is either referred by someone or not. This information does not change across stages.
- Example: If **Alice** was referred by _Priya Gupta_, she will always show `"Referred by: Priya Gupta"` no matter if she is in **applied**, **screen**, or even **rejected** stage.

### Why not in all stages?

- Adding `referredBy` inside every stage would **duplicate data** unnecessarily.
- Referrals are a **one-time event** (who introduced the candidate), not something that evolves with each hiring stage.

### Implementation

- `referredBy` is stored as a **column in the candidates table**.
- In the UI (`CandidateCard.jsx`), it is displayed only if a candidate has a referral:
  ```jsx
  {
  	candidate.referredBy && <h5>Referred by: {candidate.referredBy}</h5>;
  }
  ```

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements

- âœ… Add drag-and-drop jobs board
- âœ… Candidate profile with notes
- ðŸ”² Authentication & login system
- ðŸ”² Real backend integration (Express.js / Node.js)
- ðŸ”² Advanced search & filtering for jobs/candidates
- ðŸ”² Analytics dashboard
